- `cargo run -- test-file.html` renders a page
- No 3rd party libraries are used
- Using ffi to use system libraries are OK, granted they're common and ubiquitous libraries
- You can use OS/desktop/compositor-available APIs, but you have to write the glue code yourself
- All code is relevant to rendering the page
- Focus on quality, stability and correctness
- No source code file should be larger than 1000 lines of code, refactor as needed (use `cloc --by-file src` to verify)
- Modularize your code like a professional software developer
- When applicable, our implementation should conform with existing standards available in `vendor/*`
- Write small/short developer/debugging tools/binaries as needed, document them, and leave them for future use.
- If you have to change the baseline for our regression-tests, really ensure you're correctly updating the baselines, and the new behaviour is what we want
